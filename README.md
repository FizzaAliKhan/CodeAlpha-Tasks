In this task, we are working on a **classification problem** where the goal is to predict the species of iris flowers based on four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains 150 samples of three species (*Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*), and the species labels are converted into numerical categories for machine learning purposes. A **Decision Tree Classifier** is used to train the model on 70% of the dataset. The decision tree algorithm splits the data based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure that helps classify the flowers. After training, the model is evaluated on the remaining 30% of the data by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report that provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between different iris species based on their physical characteristics, a fundamental example of supervised learning in machine learning.
